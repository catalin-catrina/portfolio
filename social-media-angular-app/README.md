# Social Media Angular App (to be named upon completion)

### Why This Project Stands Out

- **Custom-Built UI Components:** Every UI component in this application is designed and developed entirely by me. This ensures a unique and tailored user experience without relying on third-party UI libraries such as Angular Material or PrimeNG (which I like and normally use, but this project has self-educational purposes).
  
- **100% Original Work:** While many portfolio projects are based on tutorials or courses from YouTube or other platforms like Udemy, my project is entirely built from scratch by me. This project showcases my ability to design and develop scalable, maintainable frontend architectures without relying on copy-pasted code or external UI libraries.

### Work in Progress

This project is a work in progress, and I'm continuously enhancing its features and functionalities. I invite you to explore my work so far and stay tuned for upcoming updates!
